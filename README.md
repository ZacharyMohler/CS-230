# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a small game company. They currently had an application for android systems that they wanted to expand to be available on other platforms. 

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I was very consice and straight forward with my recommendations, which I believe is essential to creating a good design document.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The preparation of having a well thought out design document not only provides a great bluiprint to work from, but also insight to understanding the requirements.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would chose to improve the _evaluation_ section to be slightly more detailed. I would also have preferred to use full sentences opposed to a brief list of facts.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs are of the upmost importance because without a user there is no need for a program to exist. I interpreted the user's needs by regularly viewing the program from the user's perspective. 

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The creation of class diagrams and UML diagrams is a very useful tool when designing software. I plan to utilize my skills learned in this class to create in depth class and UML diagrams for my programs. 

This type of documentation is also essential to keeping up with best practices--something I am very passionate about.
